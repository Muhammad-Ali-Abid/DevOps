## Introduction

Linux is the backbone of modern DevOps workflows. Most servers, containers, and cloud infrastructures run on Linux, making it essential for DevOps engineers to understand its architecture, concepts, and system design.

---

## Why Linux is Important in DevOps

* Open-source, cost-effective, and widely adopted in enterprises.
* Stable and secure OS for running production workloads.
* Foundation for **Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform**, and more.
* Enables automation through **shell scripting** and system tools.

---

## Linux Architecture

Linux follows a **layered architecture** consisting of:

### 1. Kernel

* Core of the OS; manages hardware and system resources.
* Handles **memory, CPU scheduling, device drivers, file systems, networking**.

### 2. System Libraries

* Provide APIs for applications to interact with the kernel.
* Example: GNU C Library (`glibc`).

### 3. System Utilities

* Essential tools for system management.
* Includes low-level utilities for managing processes, files, and configurations.

### 4. Shell

* Command-line interface between users and OS.
* Popular shells: **Bash, Zsh, Fish**.

### 5. Application Programs

* End-user tools (editors, browsers, DevOps tools like Docker).

## Essential Linux Concepts for DevOps

### File System Hierarchy

* `/` → Root directory
* `/home` → User directories
* `/etc` → Configuration files
* `/var` → Logs, spool files
* `/bin`, `/sbin` → Essential binaries
* `/usr` → User-installed software

### User & Group Management

* Linux is multi-user. Users and groups define permissions and security.
* Managed via configuration files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`).

### Permissions & Ownership

* Permissions: **read (r), write (w), execute (x)**.
* Ownership: defined by **user** and **group**.
* Crucial for security in shared systems.

### Processes & Services

* **Processes**: Running instances of programs.
* **Services/Daemons**: Background processes managed by `systemd` or `init`.
* DevOps requires understanding process lifecycle and service management.

### Networking Basics

* IP addressing, DNS, routing, and firewalls are critical.
* Linux provides tools for monitoring and configuring network interfaces.

### Package Management

* Linux distributions differ in package managers:

  * Debian/Ubuntu → `apt`
  * RedHat/CentOS → `yum` / `dnf`
* Ensures easy installation, upgrading, and removal of software.

### System Monitoring

* Performance metrics: CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
* Logging system (`/var/log`, `journalctl`) provides insights for troubleshooting.

### Shell Scripting

* Automates repetitive tasks.
* Powers infrastructure automation alongside DevOps tools like Ansible.

---

## Linux in DevOps Workflows

* **Infrastructure Automation**: Shell scripts + Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).
* **Containers**: Docker uses Linux kernel features (namespaces, cgroups).
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: Most run on Linux-based agents/servers.
* **Monitoring & Logging**: Built-in logging systems and integration with tools like Prometheus, ELK Stack, Grafana.

---

## Conclusion

Linux is the foundation of DevOps. Mastering Linux architecture, file system, permissions, networking, and automation equips engineers to manage infrastructure and deploy applications reliably at scale.
