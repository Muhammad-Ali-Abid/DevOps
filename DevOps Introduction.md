## Introduction to DevOps
DevOps is a collaborative philosophy that merges **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** teams to streamline software delivery. It focuses on automation, continuous delivery, and seamless collaboration to improve deployment frequency, shorten development cycles, and produce more reliable software.

---

## Why DevOps?
- **Faster Time to Market**
- **Enhanced Collaboration**
- **Improved Quality & Reliability**
- **Reduced Failure Rates & Faster Recovery Times**
- **Increased Automation & Efficiency**

---

## Key Components
### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
Automatically integrate code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository.

### 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
Automate the delivery of applications to testing and production environments.

### 3. Microservices
Design architecture around small, independent services.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Provision and manage infrastructure using code and automation tools.

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
Track performance and quickly detect issues.

## DevOps Lifecycle
1. **Plan** → Requirement gathering & task planning
2. **Code** → Application development
3. **Build** → Compile and package code
4. **Test** → Automated and manual testing
5. **Release** → Scheduling and approvals
6. **Deploy** → Application deployment
7. **Operate** → Infrastructure management
8. **Monitor** → System measurement & alerts

## CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline automates code integration, testing, and deployment:

```
Developer Commit → Version Control → CI Server → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor
```

#### Pipeline Phases
- **Source** → Code repository triggers pipeline
- **Build** → Convert source code to runnable artifact
- **Test** → Unit, integration & performance testing
- **Deploy** → Push to staging or production environment
- **Monitor** → Real-time tracking of system performance

## Popular DevOps Tools
| Purpose                | Tools                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Version Control        | Git, SVN                                  |
| CI/CD                 | Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI              |
| Containers            | Docker, Podman                            |
| Orchestration         | Kubernetes, Docker Swarm                  |
| IaC                   | Terraform, Pulumi                         |
| Config Management     | Ansible, Chef, Puppet                     |
| Monitoring            | Prometheus, Nagios, Grafana               |
| Logging              | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)|

## Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring focuses on metrics (CPU, memory), whereas logging looks into system/application logs. Together they enable **observability**.

- **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus, Datadog, Zabbix
- **Logging Tools:** Splunk, Graylog, ELK

---

## Security in DevOps (DevSecOps)
Incorporating security early into the DevOps process is known as DevSecOps.
- **Static Analysis (SAST)** during code stage
- **Dependency Scanning** in build stage
- **Runtime Protection** in deployment stage

---

## Conclusion
DevOps is not just a set of tools — it is a culture, methodology, and set of best practices that brings developers and operations together. Mastering DevOps requires hands-on skills across development, automation, cloud, security, and continuous delivery.
