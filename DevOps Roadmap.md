## Foundational Knowledge

* Understand **DevOps culture** and principles
* Learn **Agile methodology** and Scrum basics
* Understand **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**

---

## Version Control Systems

* **Git** fundamentals: clone, commit, branch, merge, rebase
* **Remote repositories**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
* Branching strategies: Git Flow, trunk-based development

---

## Operating Systems & Networking

* **Linux basics**: file system, permissions, processes
* Important commands: `ls`, `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `ps`, `top`
* **Networking fundamentals**: TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS
* Tools: `curl`, `wget`, `netstat`, `ss`, `ping`, `traceroute`

---

## Programming & Scripting

* **Shell scripting (Bash)** for automation
* **Python** for advanced scripting & automation
* Learn basics of Go or Java (optional, for tooling)

---

## Build & Package Management

* Understand build tools: **Maven, Gradle, npm, pip**
* Package managers: **apt, yum, pip, npm**
* Artifact repositories: **JFrog Artifactory, Nexus, GitHub Packages**

---

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery vs Deployment

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically integrate code changes, run tests, and generate builds.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Ensure production-ready builds are always available. Deployment to production requires **manual approval**.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Extends Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying every change that passes tests into production.

> âš¡ In DevOps, the term **CI/CD** may refer to either **Continuous Delivery** or **Continuous Deployment**, depending on how automated the release process is.

---

## Containers & Orchestration

* **Docker**: images, containers, volumes, networks
* **Kubernetes (K8s)**: pods, deployments, services, config maps, secrets
* Container registries: Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, GitHub Container Registry

---

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

* **Terraform** basics: providers, resources, state management
* CloudFormation or Pulumi (alternatives)
* Best practices for modular IaC

---

## Configuration Management

* Tools: Ansible, Puppet, Chef, SaltStack
* Automating server configuration and deployments
* Writing playbooks, manifests, and recipes

---

## Monitoring, Logging & Observability

* **Metrics monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
* **Centralized logging**: ELK Stack, Graylog
* **Tracing**: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry
* Alerting systems: Alertmanager, PagerDuty

---

## Cloud Platforms

* **AWS**: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, EKS
* **Azure**: VM, Blob Storage, AKS
* **GCP**: Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, GKE
* Multi-cloud and hybrid cloud fundamentals

---

## Security & DevSecOps

* Secure coding practices
* **Static & dynamic analysis (SAST/DAST)**
* Secrets management: Vault, KMS
* Compliance: SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA basics

---

## Collaboration & Project Management

* **Agile tools**: Jira, Trello, Asana
* Documentation: Markdown, Confluence, wikis
* Communication: Slack, MS Teams, email etiquette

---

## Best Practices & Soft Skills

* Write clean, modular, and reusable scripts
* Emphasize **automation everywhere**
* Learn troubleshooting & debugging strategies
* Collaboration and cross-team communication
* Continuous learning: follow DevOps communities, blogs, open source projects
